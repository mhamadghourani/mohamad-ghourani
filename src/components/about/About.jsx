        <h3>Self-Taught Full-Stack Developer</h3>
        <p>
          Hello! I&apos;m Mohamad, a self-taught full-stack developer passionate
          about building high-quality web applications. I specialize in both
          front-end and back-end development, with a deep understanding of
          JavaScript, Java, React.js, Spring Boot, Node.js, and more. I’m always
          driven by a love for technology and problem-solving, and I
          continuously improve my skills to create seamless and dynamic digital
          experiences.
        </p>
        <h4>My Skills and Technologies</h4>
        <p>
          As a full-stack developer, I have expertise in a wide range of
          technologies that allow me to build scalable and interactive web
          applications.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Front-End Development:</strong> I’m skilled in React.js,
            building modern, interactive user interfaces. I also use Material UI
            and Bootstrap to create visually appealing, responsive designs that
            enhance the user experience. Additionally, Framer Motion enables me
            to add smooth animations and transitions, bringing life to my
            projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Back-End Development:</strong> I use Java and Spring Boot to
            create powerful server-side applications. I also have extensive
            experience with Node.js and Express.js for building fast and
            efficient RESTful APIs, supporting data-driven web applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Databases:</strong> I am experienced with SQL databases such
            as MySQL and PostgreSQL, as well as NoSQL solutions like MongoDB.
            I’m capable of designing database schemas, writing optimized
            queries, and ensuring the security and integrity of data.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What I Love About Development</h3>
        <p>
          I’m deeply passionate about software development. The thrill of
          solving complex problems and seeing my work come to life is what
          drives me. I enjoy the process of building applications that are both
          functional and beautiful. React.js helps me create user-friendly,
          interactive UIs, while Spring Boot and Node.js give me the tools to
          build powerful, scalable back-end services. When I’m coding, I lose
          track of time because I’m so immersed in the task at hand.
        </p>
        <h3>Google Project Management Certification</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to my technical skills, I’ve earned the Google Project
          Management Certificate. This certification has taught me essential
          skills in project planning, team coordination, and task
          prioritization. With this knowledge, I’m able to effectively manage my
          development projects, ensuring they are delivered on time and meet the
          highest standards. It also allows me to maintain strong communication
          with team members and stakeholders, ensuring everyone is aligned with
          project goals.
        </p>
